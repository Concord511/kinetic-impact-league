# Customer Project Default - Plugins: Routines

Routines are repeatable processes in the workflow.  Similar to trees routines have a "start" and "return".  Unlike trees Routines are intended to be initiated within a workflow process.

Routines allow workflow developers to take segments of workflow processes common to many workflows and encapsulate them for reuse.
